REPLACEMENT ASSIGNMENT BATTLEBOT
Project battlebot is a project where hardware interfacing, infrastructure and professional skills meet. So the replacement assignment should be one that contains all these elements and combines them into one useful assignment. 
THE ASSIGNMENT
Students that partake in the assignment will have to work on several elements to create a fully functional autonomous robot. Below is a short description of these elements and how they should work.
Robot
The robot is a pre-built robot which the students can retrieve from the teachers workspace. Students should program the robot so that it can receive orders/instructions from a server instance. The robot should be able to do the following assignments based on a command/instruction received from the server.
- Drive a predefined route
	The predefined route is one that will be established by the students. All robots will drive the same route to the best of their abilities. Students will supply the robot with the appropriate programming for this challenge.
- Follow a line
	The robot should be able to follow a line based on sensor input. A trajectory will be placed by the students and the robots should be able to follow them to the best of their ability.
Server
A server should be programmed that can receive and send information to the robot. The server should be able to send simple commands/instructions on which the robots will start their program. 
The server should be able to receive information from an input source which the students will use to send the instructions via the server. 
Any choice of server is allowed. 
Input source
The students will create an input source where to put in their commands for the robot. The input source will relay these commands towards the server which in turn will send them to the robot. 
Vice versa the input source should be able to display information which has been sent from the robot to the server and relayed from the server to the input source.
